# AngularPokemonSearch

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5.

It provides a main component that implements different pages (currently only has one component page, more will be added in the future).

The current component implemented on this page is a form that permits the user to search for a pokemon's data using either its Pokedex ID or name. After doing so, it permits the user to visualize and interact with some of its stats, or to pick another pokemon.

This project was used to exercise and utilize a few important Angular components and functionalities, such as observables and subjects, data binding, etc.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
