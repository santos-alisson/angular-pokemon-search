# AngularPokemonSearch

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5.

It provides a main component that implements different pages (currently only has one component page, more will be added in the future).

The current component implemented on this page is a form that permits the user to search for a pokemon's data using either its Pokedex ID or name. After doing so, it permits the user to visualize and interact with some of its stats, or to pick another pokemon.

This project was used to exercise and utilize a few important Angular components and functionalities, such as observables and subjects, data binding, etc.

## Running the project

Run `npm run start` to run the application, which will open in `http://localhost:4200/`.
